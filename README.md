# OHDSI extension Schema.org
This repository contains an OHDSI extension to the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary. The extension include new types and properties that can be used to describe metadata of digital resources in OHDSI. 

The [extension](https://github.com/thehyve/ohdsi-schemas/blob/master/models/ohdsi_model/ohdsi_semantic_model.ttl) is documented in Turtle, a common data format for storing data in RDF.

# Schema.org and JSON-LD
Capturing metadata using standards like [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) and [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) enables metadata to be machine-readable and structured. This makes data more Findable, Interoperable and hence more Reusable (see the [FAIR princiles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)).
This repository contains [examples](https://github.com/thehyve/ohdsi-schemas/tree/master/models/populated_examples) of metadata of digital resources in OHDSI in JSON-LD.
